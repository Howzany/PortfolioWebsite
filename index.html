    <h2>About Me</h2> <!-- seems like having the article tag means I can't use li within it without using also ol or ul but ol and ul doesn't work when h3 is inside it-->
   
        <h3>Start Up Experience</h3>
        <p>I was a part of the start up community during my undergraduate years at UC Berkeley and I participated in many pitch competitions and tried to create my own start up 3 times but failed and learned many lessons along the way. One such lesson was that I might have been more successful had I known how to code on my own in addition to working with others who knew how to code so that we could collaborate easier with a shared understanding of how things worked in web development and having the mutual knowledge to communicate the tech requirements.</p><!-- passion for web development statement -->
        <h3>Creative Collaborator</h3>
        <p>While I have experienced a lot and tried my hand at many things such as film making, film editing, and acting, I've always had a continued interest in the creative side of web development, coding, and possibly even game design. Regardless, I am always interested and passionate in the creative, co-creative, and collaborative process and I thrive in an environment of organized creative chaos and excel at multitasking.</p><!-- other interests -->

<!-- I have manually double checked every single tag and end tag and documented with comments where each one is started and ended to indicate how they are paired up. The validator is wrong-->
