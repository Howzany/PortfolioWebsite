        <h3>Start Up Experience</h3>
        <p>I was a part of the start up community during my undergraduate years at UC Berkeley and I participated in many pitch competitions and tried to create my own start up 3 times but failed and learned many lessons along the way. One such lesson was that I might have been more successful had I known how to code on my own in addition to working with others who knew how to code so that we could collaborate easier with a shared understanding of how things worked in web development and having the mutual knowledge to communicate the tech requirements.</p><!-- passion for web development statement --> </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Creative Collaborator</h3>
        <p>While I have experienced a lot and tried my hand at many things such as film making, film editing, and acting, I've always had a continued interest in the creative side of web development, coding, and possibly even game design. Regardless, I am always interested and passionate in the creative, co-creative, and collaborative process and I thrive in an environment of organized creative chaos and excel at multitasking.</p><!-- other interests --> </li>
